# Build Log

One entry per step: what was done, why, commands run, and real output.

## 2026-09-23 — Step 0: Brainstorm and design spec

**What:** Researched existing voice/computer-use projects and the Laya decision model, then
agreed a design through Q&A. Wrote the design spec.

**Why:** No existing project met all requirements (local Ollama, native Swift, kill switch,
safe by design), so we are building one.

**Key decisions** (full list in `docs/specs/2026-09-23-design.md` §2):

- Single menu-bar app with Hardened Runtime. Full App Sandbox is impossible because the sandbox
  blocks the Accessibility API needed to click/type in other apps; safety is enforced in code.
- Push-to-talk only (⌃⌥V). Kill switch ⌃⌥⌘K.
- Plan approved by you, then step-by-step execution through a safety gate.
- Forbidden actions (delete, pay, sign out, …) are always blocked; any guard hit shows a popup.
- Model: `qwen3-vl:8b` on local Ollama.

**Commands:**

```
$ mkdir -p mac-voice-assistant/docs/{specs,plans} && git init -b main
Initialized empty Git repository in .../mac-voice-assistant/.git/
```

**Environment found:** Apple M2, 16 GB, macOS 26.6.2 · Xcode 26.3 · Swift 6.2.4 ·
`swift format` 6.2.3 · Apple Development cert present · Ollama 0.6.8 (Homebrew, needs upgrade)
with only `nomic-embed-text` installed.

## 2026-09-23 — Step 1: Senior-dev review, grilling, spec v2

**What:** Reviewed spec v1 as a senior dev, found holes, and resolved 23 design questions one by
one. Renamed the project **Glim** (folder `mac-voice-assistant/` → `glim/`). Rewrote the spec.
Recorded every question and answer.

**Why:** v1 had gaps: the app blocklist failed open (IDEs with built-in terminals were not
blocked), `Don't Save` / `Replace` / `Allow` were not forbidden, the kill switch died with the
app, and nothing checked that the clicked element matched the approved plan.

**Main changes** (full list in `docs/decisions/2026-09-23-design-questions-and-answers.md`):

- Four trust tiers, default-deny: Never-touch · Read-only · Supervised · Full control.
- Plan-match check, human-takeover auto-stop, watchdog process owning ⌃⌥⌘K.
- Laya (local service now, CoreML later) and opt-in Jev as second-opinion checkers; a
  disagreement counts only when the checker is confident; checker offline → confirm every step.
- Everything editable; loosening needs Touch ID; settings sealed with an HMAC.
- UI: notch pill for status, centered panels for decisions, Liquid Glass control panel.
- Code standards section enforced by `swift format lint --strict`.

**Commands:**

```
$ mv mac-voice-assistant glim && mkdir -p glim/docs/decisions
$ # bundle IDs for default tiers read from each app's Info.plist with PlistBuddy
```

**Lesson:** in zsh, `path` is tied to `$PATH`; naming a loop variable `path` broke `head` and
every lookup. Use descriptive names like `app_path`.

## 2026-09-23 — Task 1: Package scaffold and action vocabulary

**What:** `Package.swift` (Swift 6 mode, macOS 26, `GlimCore` + tests), `.swift-format`
(generated from `swift format dump-configuration`, then line length 100, 4 spaces, and the six
required rules switched on), `scripts/check.sh` (build → test → strict lint) and
`scripts/format.sh`. Action vocabulary: `ActionKind`, `AllowedKey`, `ScrollDirection`,
`WindowPreset`, `StepAction`, `Plan`, `ProposedAction`, `AppIdentity`, `UIElementSnapshot`.

**Why:** Every later unit speaks this vocabulary. `StepAction` makes impossible actions
unrepresentable: there is no case for deleting files or running scripts. `AllowedKey` has no
Delete key. `UIElementSnapshot.describingTexts` leaves out the value, because a field's content
may be written by someone else and must not change the risk verdict.

**TDD:** tests written first; `swift build` failed with "target 'GlimCore' ... is empty";
after implementing, 9 tests (18 cases) passed.

**Gates:** `scripts/check.sh` → `All gates passed.`

## 2026-09-23 — Task 2: Trust tiers and app trust policy

**What:** `TrustTier` (Never-touch < Read-only < Supervised < Full control, `Comparable`),
`TierPermission`, `AppTrustPolicy` with default-deny lookup and the §8.2 permission matrix.

**Why:** Default-deny (B-Q1): unknown apps are read-only. `highestTierForUnverifiedApps` caps
any app whose signature failed validation at read-only, so an impostor using
`com.apple.Notes` gains nothing, while an impostor of a never-touch app stays never-touch
(review focus 3).

**TDD:** failed with "cannot find 'TrustTier' in scope"; then 6 tests incl. a 25-case
permission matrix passed.

**Gates:** `All gates passed.` (15 tests)

## 2026-09-23 — Task 3: Safety limits, risk word lists, safe defaults

**What:** `SafetyLimits` (20 actions, 3 tries, 0.25 s spacing, 180 s timeout, 3 unchanged,
500 characters), `RiskWordLists`, `SafetyDefaults` (the Forbidden/Confirm phrases and the four
tier lists with real bundle IDs read from this Mac), `SafetyPolicy.safeDefaults`.

**Why:** One named home for every business rule, each with a doc comment saying business rule
or tunable. Tier lists are applied most-restrictive-last, and a test proves no app is listed
twice.

**TDD:** failed with "cannot find 'SafetyPolicy' in scope"; then 27 tests passed.

**Gates:** `All gates passed.`

## 2026-09-23 — Task 4: Risk classifier

**What:** `RiskLevel` and `RiskClassifier`: whole-word, case-insensitive phrase matching across
every text describing a control; Forbidden wins over Confirm.

**Why:** Labels come in many spellings. Normalizing drops apostrophes ("Don’t Save" = "Dont
Save") and turns hyphens, tabs, ellipses and non-breaking spaces into single spaces, so
"SIGN-OUT" and "Sign Out" are still forbidden (review focus 1), while "Deleted Items",
"Sender" and "Postpone" stay safe. Blank phrases in an edited list are ignored so they can't
match everything.

**TDD:** failed with "cannot find type 'RiskLevel' in scope"; then 35 tests passed.

**Gates:** `All gates passed.`
