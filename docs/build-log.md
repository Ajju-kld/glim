# Build Log

One entry per step: what was done, why, commands run, and real output.

## 2026-09-23 — Step 0: Brainstorm and design spec

**What:** Researched existing voice/computer-use projects and the Laya decision model, then
agreed a design through Q&A. Wrote the design spec.

**Why:** No existing project met all requirements (local Ollama, native Swift, kill switch,
safe by design), so we are building one.

**Key decisions** (full list in `docs/specs/2026-09-23-design.md` §2):

- Single menu-bar app with Hardened Runtime. Full App Sandbox is impossible because the sandbox
  blocks the Accessibility API needed to click/type in other apps; safety is enforced in code.
- Push-to-talk only (⌃⌥V). Kill switch ⌃⌥⌘K.
- Plan approved by you, then step-by-step execution through a safety gate.
- Forbidden actions (delete, pay, sign out, …) are always blocked; any guard hit shows a popup.
- Model: `qwen3-vl:8b` on local Ollama.

**Commands:**

```
$ mkdir -p mac-voice-assistant/docs/{specs,plans} && git init -b main
Initialized empty Git repository in .../mac-voice-assistant/.git/
```

**Environment found:** Apple M2, 16 GB, macOS 26.6.2 · Xcode 26.3 · Swift 6.2.4 ·
`swift format` 6.2.3 · Apple Development cert present · Ollama 0.6.8 (Homebrew, needs upgrade)
with only `nomic-embed-text` installed.
